# CUDA Benchmark

Measure matrix calculations execution/transfer time between CPU and GPU (CUDA).
\
\
Evaluate the impact of block size on execution time with varying input size and vice versa.

## Build

Simply build with `make`, no external dependencies apart from the toolchain, see [Requirements](doc/DEV.md#requirements).

## Usage

The options are straightforward but they may keep changing with future updates.
\
\
Run `cuda-benchmark` with no arguments for help.
